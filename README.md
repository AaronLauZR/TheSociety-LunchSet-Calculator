This calculator determines how to allocate the discount for the restaurant’s lunch set promotion, where customers receive one free meal for every four meals ordered. It prorates the free meal discount across all ordered meals based on each meal’s proportion of the total prediscount cost, and then displays the final price of each meal after the discount.
